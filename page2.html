            <h1>The Legend of Ergenekon</h1>
            <h3>Stuck in the Valley</h3>
            <p> Since there was no way out from the Altai mountains, the Turks settled into the Valley. However, as generations passed, people started to wonder; what was out there, outside the valley? They have only heard from their great grand parents what was there, and wanted to go and see for themselves, the rest of the world. </p>
