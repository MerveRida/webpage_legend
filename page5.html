            <h3>Discovering The Way Out</h3>
            <p> Asena howled when they arrived at the edge of the Altai Mountain. The blacksmith couldn't understnad. He came closer and closer and Asena kept howling when he looked where Asena was standing on, he saw that there was raw iron. When he analyzed the environment more, he discovered that the part of the mountain Asena showed him was made up of iron, and it could be the door out. </p>
