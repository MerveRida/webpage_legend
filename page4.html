            <h3>The Gray Wolf: Asena</h3>
            <p> One day, as the blacksmith was working on iron, a gray wolf named Asena approached him. The blacksmith was not scared, but couldn't understand why the Asena was looking at him for such a long time. When he looked in Asena's eyes he found sincerity. He felt like Asena wanted to show him something, so he left the iron and followed Asena to the edges of the valley. </p>
