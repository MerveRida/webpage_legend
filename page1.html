            <p> Following a military defeat, the ancient Turks took refuge in the legendary Ergenekon valley. </p>

            <p>A scene from Altai Mountains</p>
            <p> The Ergenekon Valley was surrounded by the large Altai mountains, and was very safe because there was no way to come in.
                <br> However, that meant that there was also no way out, so the Turks were stuck in the Ergenekon Valley for four centuries.
